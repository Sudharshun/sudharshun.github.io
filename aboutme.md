### My story

Hey, Iâ€™m Sudharshun.

It all started with an old Apple IIe. What started as a summer holiday pastime salvaging and putting together PCs from our neighborhood used goods store with my father has eventually grown into a lifelong admiration for all things computer. From those early bug filled programs in GWBASIC to the rough screens created using Visual Basic as a gawky teenager in 1996, when I first started working with computers, to working on Web services, Portals and Micro-services today, my love for computers has not only eaten up my pocket money and my after school evening hours as a youngster, but also dictated my Career choice as an adult. It was that love of coding that brought me 8000 miles from the sunny and humid sea shores of my hometown to a freezing but warm-cozy welcoming lakeshore of this wonderful city in 2009.

Technology and Computers make me feel like the Eternal Freshman. I learn something new everyday. When I am not at work, I love tinkering with Raspberry Pi , Arduino or these days trying my hand coding a bot or Alexa skill. I also collect Commando World War 2 comics and love going on roadtrips.

I live with my wife and 6 year old daughter in Buffalo Grove.
